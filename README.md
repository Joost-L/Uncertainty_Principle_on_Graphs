# Uncertainty_Principle_on_Graphs
Code for a uu group project about the uncertainty principle on graphs

## Finding our results:
The main branch contains all of our code. We have 8 seperate branches, for each type of graph we have 2 branches for our two different values for the average degree d. On each of these branches you can view our raw data saved in lists, and also the resulting plots
